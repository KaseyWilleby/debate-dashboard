    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to address the 'Missing or insufficient permissions' error by enforcing authorization independence and role-based access control. The structure uses path-based ownership for user data and a dedicated collection for admin roles. Denormalization is employed to avoid using `get()` in security rules, enabling atomic operations and improving debuggability. Segregation of data into collections with homogeneous security postures simplifies rules and supports secure list operations.\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles. Access is restricted to the user themselves (path-based ownership). This addresses the user list error by restricting access.\n*   `/users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}`: Stores sessions owned by a specific user (either as host or client). This uses path-based ownership to ensure only the user can access their sessions. The `hostId` and `clientId` fields are denormalized from the `User` entity.\n*   `/users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}/messages/{messageId}`: Stores messages within a session. This continues the path-based ownership, restricting access to participants of the session. The `senderId` is denormalized from the `User` entity.\n*   `/roles_admin/{userId}`: A dedicated collection to store admin roles. The existence of a document in this collection grants admin privileges. Existence over content is leveraged.\n\nThis structure achieves Authorization Independence by denormalizing authorization-related data (e.g., `hostId`, `clientId`, `senderId`) into subcollections. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules, enabling atomic operations and improving scalability. The structure supports the required QAPs by segregating data based on access control requirements. Path-based ownership and role-based access using the `/roles_admin` collection ensure that only authorized users can access specific data."
